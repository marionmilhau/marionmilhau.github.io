            <p>The company's customers will be able to purshase a range of products from the queen bee to an entire hive.<br><br>The team wanted a logo that remind the modern and terroir aspects of the company:<br><br>• Modern because they are experts and they use modern technologies and technics in their process.<br><br>• Terroir because they feel close to their beautiful region, the South of France, and to their customers as well.</p>

          <h1 class="title" id="title4">Creation process</h1>
          <p>My logo creation process is divided in 6 steps:</p>
          <p><strong>1. Creating a moodboard</strong><br>After getting the briefing from my client, I felt the 'vibe' they want to create for their branding. I inspired myself on pinterest or google image. I created 3 moodboards: one with words, one for logos and one for colors.</p>
          <p><strong>2. Sketching</strong><br>When I got an idea of the branding univers, I started sketching on paper any ideas that came to mind. I tried to not put any judgement on my scketches and to diversify them as much as I can.</p>
          <p><strong>3. Digital sketching</strong><br>I selected several logos that I liked on paper and made them as vectors on Adobe Illustrator. It gave a way better idea of what the logo would look like once finished. I made some changes here and there and elaborated 4 logos.</p>
          <p><strong>4. Presentation</strong><br>I made a presentation on InDesign for each logo with their version on a light background, their version on a dark background and a short description of what this logo was representing and why it fits with the briefing. Then, the client choose which one they prefered.</p>
          <p><strong>5. Adjustments</strong><br>Sometimes, the client will want to make some changes on the logo they chose, that was the case here. We changed the color of the thyme branch for a green one and made a version of the logo with the branch inside the hexagon.</p>
          <p><strong>6. File export</strong><br>The last step of the process is the file export of your logo. Depending on what you agreed on with your client in your quote, you'll need to export several files.<br><br>For this project, I exported the logo in its normal version, white version and dark version. Each one in .png with transparent background, .jpeg which can be used as social media thumbnail and .eps which is the vectorized version.</p>

          <h1 class="title" id="title5">Moodboard</h1>
          <div class="card_text">
            <p>My first moodboard is a 'word board' which means that I put all the words linked to the project. For this project, I put the words bee, hives, beekeeper, nature, agriculture, terroir, modern, expertise, technology, technic and ecology.<br><br>Then I made the 2nd moodboard with all the colors that were inspiring me: olive green, gold, teal and orange.<br><br>The last moodboard is the one I use for the logo itself. I get inpired by the different shapes and colors: circular shapes, nature element drawings, hive shapes and so on.</p>

          <div class="card_text">
            <p style="margin-bottom:10px !important;">This design shows the silhouette of one of the most emblematic peaks in the region. It transmits the idea of terroir and nature. The use of a classic font shows that the brand is class and high-end.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="logo3">
            <img class="logocard2" src="img/rucher/logocard4_1.png" alt="logo rucher">
            <img class="logocard2" id="right" src="img/rucher/logocard4_2.png" alt="logo rucher">
          </div>
          <div class="card_text">
            <p>This design is more natural, modern and thin. The thyme, in the centre, represents the 'garigue', the country side fields that are quite iconic of the region and reminds us of the plants that bees gather.<br><br>The fonts are more refined without being too feminine and support the nature side. This logo recalls all the products that the company can produce and ,therefore, can be easily declined.</p>

          <div class="card_text">
            <p   style="margin-bottom:10px !important;">This logo is the most modern proposal. It has a geometrical shape that gives a technological aspect without forgetting the bees with the colour of the hexagon.</p>

          <div class="logo4">
            <img class="logocard2" src="img/rucher/logocard5_1.png" alt="logo rucher">

          </div>
          <div class="card_text">
            <p>This design is a good compromise between the modernity of the honeycomb associated with the thyme branch which gives a natural touch and reminds us of the plants that bees gather. The bees are found both in the plants and in the shape of the honeycomb.</p>
